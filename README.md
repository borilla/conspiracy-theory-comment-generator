# conspiracy-theory-comment-generator

## What it does

Generates YouTube-style comments on conspiracy theories

## How it does it

It scrapes comments from YouTube videos (currently hard-coded to [FLAT EARTH - How can NASA recover from this, EVER???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksSZPNQaFP8)),
feeds those comments into a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) text generator and uses this generator to
produce some new similar-sounding comments

## Try it out

It's a work in progress but to see what it does so far:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/borilla/conspiracy-theory-comment-generator

# switch to the repo directory
cd conspiracy-theory-comment-generator

# install required modules
npm install

# run the program
node index.js
```

Output looks something like:

```
I don't ether. But i have a great zoom out to make. 1st, two astronomy studies - that they could see
stars aren't visible sorry i understand talking about, besides that they think their cell phones
were asked several sand clocks just incase the stars when looking up at night at the space at 50,000
mph.

How can NASA recover from inside or outside? Personally, I have no concept of physics and just go by
their stupidity and shut them up there? I even hate the face on the moon is 180 degree about the
other side to investigate? because of completely brain dead or programming are using the data and
everything. In doing so, you filter out the dinosaurs 66 millions of smart and honest science. You
wil never EVER EVER EVER BELIEVE ANYTHING OUR GOVERNMENTS (ALL OF THEM, EVERY SINGLE ONE ON EARTH)
TELL US/TOLD US EVER NOT EVER NEVER. And he warned us over an hour?

--------

They are gods.

--------

if a spirit level touches the let line or right it is a realm, a system works?

You do not feel embarrassed by your discover the experience. To which they have a great zoom out to
make. 1st, two astronot but I did sleep at a holiday inn last night.

--------

why is lying

--------

The Earth or turn they are up there? I even hate the USA and yet - every country in the picture of
the first realizations I had when venturing deeper into astronaut" who is suppose the stars are
getting washed out on earth and into empty space, why do we never seen photos hahahahaha

--------

Um, maybe NASA lied about something else?

Very funny.

--------

So we paid $25.4 billion for hiding something is about this reply disrespectful, I just find the
earth ball zooming through which they have a great zoom out to make. 1st, two astronauts casually
glanced up they wore at. To also know what you can't even know where they in on the moon, wouldn't
see what his little to NO answers.

--------

What I'm having a lower ISO (200) and a surface is brighter when viewed from east to west, within
the heard.. serious that the most significantly fewer stars wont be reception by self appointed
authoritative Bull Shitters

Fact is the entire professional "Seen it on TV world", no matter and I suspect they want" when they
were suppose the film to capture the length of the moon claim that vast bodies of water is spinning.
So flat earth is flat n narnia is real

--------

this is as insulting to see stars constellation for hiding the data... haha.

LIARS.

--------

The missing the stars aren't "drowned out".

(Yep, I'm still working on finding a better generator algorithm!)
