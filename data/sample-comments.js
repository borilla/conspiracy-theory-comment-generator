They\'re lying and are hiding the data or just have had it destroyed to remove evidence of the lies. Um, we don\'t have the data, don\'t know where it could be? and wouldn\'t even know where to look. My old home videos are in a box in the attic and all my old photo\'s which are 40 yrs old plus are in the cupboard under the stairs. Some are a bit tatty but there. NASA is lying' },

	{ text: 'This flat earth can be debunked real easy, if you have lived in both hemispheres as I have. First do you flat Earthers agree we only see one side on the moon or is that flat too? If you agree we only see one side of the moon and we live on a flat plain then how do you explain that the moon is seen completely 180 degree about when viewed from each hemisphere. Now you wont know unless you have been in both. I was born in the UK and grew up in Australia and the face on the moon is 180 degree about when seeing it from both. That\'s how I know if I am watching a movie and they show a picture of the moon what hemisphere the shot of the moon was in. Further more if you want a history lesson Captain Cook in 1770 was commissioned to sail to Tahiti from Great Britain to track the course of planet Venus across the face of the sun. When he got there it was cloudy and one would say what a waste of a trip, but the good old Brit\'s weren\'t that stupid so they sent at the same time a ship to the South America\'s to do the same thing which did capture the path of Venus across the Sun. They did this so they could accurately measure the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Now that\'s 250 years ago. Back then all HMS vessels would carry several sand clocks with them. This enabled them not only to keep time with London Greenwich but to also know what longitude they wore at. To also know their latitude they needed the sun, with both they could pin point their position on the GLOBE. Now this was so serious that if you fell asleep on watch and didn\'t turn the clocks on the ships bell you wore severely punished. That\'s why they had several clocks just in this case. See there is a thing called the International date line and it runs from Greenwich London England south around the world and back. So they wouldn\'t fuck up trade in Europe and cause such a time difference if they started the day from London. See we rotate East to West so everything East of London would be the day before they carefully fucked it off over the other side of the World where there is little to upset anyone. You see even back then over 250 years ago they new we live on a ball.' },

	{ text: 'SEE THESE HOSTS ARE UNDER THE BIBLE CONFUSION. THEY SEE THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY.   LETS ASK THEM TO CHAT ABOUT THE EARTH ITSELF THEY CLAIM IS FLAT.\n\nYes sir! To the natural, coherent, well reasoned and intelligent minds, the obvious signs which are seen, from the experience of twelve hours darkness, and twelve hours of sunlight. Therein lies the factual and literal evidence, that the Erath is a sphere, and it is impossible for Earth to be contextually flat; as this and many other video presenters, using irrelevant observation of the sun, to claim that the Earth is a flat mess. Their reasoning has to derived from the church bibles of lies and hoaxes. Factually, based on intelligent reasoning, what they are citing of the sun as proof for a flat Earth, is irrelevant, to what factual evidential effect requires,  concerning curvature opposed to Flat Earth. People brains are possible to get confused, when the principle of logic, is not set for coherent discernment. So this illogical flat Earth presentation, is very injurious and full of lasting consequential harm, it must stop, because there is nothing educational about it...l am very adamant about this matter and I say this!  Don\'t talk about the Sun\'s summer solstice, or its circle of any house of the zodiac;  because nothing of that proves whether the Earth is flat or round, just debate the fact of Earth\'s mass.  I am asking for elaboration, on why are there so many scattered time zones,  from east to west, within the twelve hours of sunlight, and twelve hours of darkness.  E.g.,  is Earth\'s curvature the cause why China, is seven hours ahead of the UK; but fifteen hours ahead of California? Again I ask;  is Earth\'s curvature the reason for UK 4000 miles, to cause five hours of darkness ahead of Florida, United States?    And how about 2,300 miles from Miami to California, which cause three hours of darkness?   Talk about these effects, that people see and experience everyday.  Why ignore this fierce evidence,  to draw make believe, from delusional irrelevant and idiotic so-called evidence. I expect people who still believe, in the Scandinavian revelation of Jesus Christ, to conjure up those copious follies.' },
